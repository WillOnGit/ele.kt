# ele.kt
An election simulating project written in Kotlin.

## Quickstart
With `make` and Kotlin installed, running `make` will simulate a lottery with example candidates.

To build documentation from KDoc, download the [dokka CLI](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/dokka-cli.html) and its dependent JARs to `dokka/cli/` and run `make docs`.
Output is generated in `dokka/html/`.
